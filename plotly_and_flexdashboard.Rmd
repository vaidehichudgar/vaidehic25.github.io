```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

let's load aibnb dataset
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    rating = review_scores_location / 2
  ) |> 
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long
  ) |> 
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price <= 500,
    price >= 100
  )
  
```

scatterplot -- interactive this time

could go mode = line for line
\n adds line break
label is telling r what to include in the label
```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating:", rating)
  ) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price,
    text = ~label,
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.5
  )
```


boxplot with select for neighbourhood
```{r}

nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate(
    neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood,price)
  ) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood,
    type = "box", colors = "viridis"
  )
```

barcharts
```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  count(neighbourhood) |> 
  mutate(
    neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood,n)
  ) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n,
    type = "bar"
  )
```


## ggplotly

to apply ggplotly interactivity to a ggplot
```{r}
ggp_scatter = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, color = price)) +
  geom_point()

ggplotly(ggp_scatter)
```
